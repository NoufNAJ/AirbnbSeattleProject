# Airbnb Seattle Project
This will be an analysis project for Airbnb Seattle datasets.  
# Installations
To run the Jupyter Notebook with the provided code, you'll need to install the following libraries:
-	Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install it from the official Python website. The Python version used in this project is 3.11.7
-	Anaconda: If you prefer using Anaconda, you can download and install it from the Anaconda website.
-	NumPy: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

Libraries installation:
-	numpy
conda install numpy
-	pandas
conda install pandas
-	Matplotlib
conda install matplotlib
-	seaborn
conda install seaborn

Once you have installed these libraries, you should be able to run the Jupyter Notebook without any issues.

# Project Motivation
This project was conducted as part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program, utilizing datasets sourced from the Kaggle repository. The datasets used on this project are listings and calendar for Seattle AirBnb. 

This project follows the CRISP-DM framework as outlined in the Udacity tutorials. The following steps are involved: 
1.	Business Understanding 
2.	Data Understanding 
3.	Data Preparation 
4.	Modeling 
5.	Evaluation 
6.	Deployment

The primary objectives of this project are to delve into the provided datasets and derive insights to address the following key questions: 
1.	Busiest Times for Airbnb Bookings in Seattle: The aim is to identify the peak periods of activity for Airbnb bookings in Seattle
2.	The impact of property type and room type on the pricing of Airbnb in Seattle: Significant factors that contribute to the pricing of Airbnb listings in Seattle. 
4.	Predicting Positive Review Likelihood: The goal is to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of receiving a positive review.

# File Descriptions
-	Listings_seattle.rar: This file is compressed and contains the dataset Listings_seattle.csv with information about Airbnb listings in Seattle. 
-	Calendar_seattle.rar: This file is compressed and contains the dataset Calendar_seattle.csv with information about the availability and pricing of Airbnb listings in Seattle over time. 
-	AirBnbSeattle_Project.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the project code and analysis, including data exploration, visualization, and modeling. 
-	README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, including its motivation, goals, and instructions for running the code.

# How to Interact with the project
1.	Cloning the Repository: Start by cloning or downloading the repository to your local machine. You can do this by clicking on the "Clone or download" button and selecting your preferred method.
2.	Installing Dependencies: Before running the project code, ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed. (Explained on Installation Section)
3.	Accessing the Datasets: The datasets required for the project are in the same repository. You can access the 'listings.csv' and 'calendar.csv' files for analysis.
4.	Running the Jupyter Notebook: Open the 'AirBnbSeattle_Project.ipynb' Jupyter Notebook to interact with the project code. You can run each cell in the notebook to execute the code and observe the results.
5.	Exploring the Analysis and results: The Jupyter Notebook contains sections organized based on the three questions and answered by charts and analysis.
